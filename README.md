# Memory-Game-code-along



## Overview

In this code-along session, we created a simple Memory Game using HTML and CSS. The goal was to help you understand how to structure a webpage with HTML and style it using CSS. By the end of the session, you should have a basic understanding of building and styling a webpage from scratch.

## Project Description

The Memory Game is a fun and interactive way to test your memory and concentration. Players flip cards to find matching pairs. The game continues until all pairs are matched.
